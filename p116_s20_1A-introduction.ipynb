It has modules for Grover's seach and Shor's factoring algorithms as well as tools that will be helpful for quantum simulation and measurement schemes. This will be the package used to run algorithms on simulators as well as real quantum computers through the cloud\n",

It has general quantum information tools in the tensor network language such as partial traces and measures of entanglement. There are also numerical tools for matrix product states, other tensor network ansatz such as MERA, and quantum circuit optimization.\n",
